The games is played from 2-4 players. Each player is given a rack with 3 cards (a card has a color and a number). The player's own cards are not visible to them but to their opponent. Each turn, a player takes a question from the deck. A question might be like (on how many racks are there green cards?). The player answers truthfully and their answer to the question helps the other players figure out their own cards. The player to first guess their own cards, wins the game. If, he guesses wrong, he gets a new set of cards. \r\nWHY I WROTE IT:\r\n\tFor one of the classes that I took, we were tasked to create the Code 777 game for any mobile development platform. I actually chose Windows Phone 7 over android because I wanted to improve my c# skills. This project was my first major c#, Windows Phone 7 application, So, far in my academic career, before this assignment all my assignments required a console based UI. My first experience with GUI programming was with Java Swing, where I was programmatically creating the UI and using code to update a specific textbox. There was a tight coupling between the UI and the model of my application. . Using the MVVM design pattern, I was able to cleanly separate my application. Throughout the course of designing the application, I kept changing how the application would look. And since my view was only loosely coupled with the view model, I was able to experiment freely. I was surprised at how the application turned out considering I had about 5 weeks and this was my first WP7 project. \r\nSome Regrets:\r\n\tSince this was a project where I was teaching myself, I wonder if I “learned” the best way to do something. For example, in my project I have a tight coupling between my vie model and view. Coud I have avoided it?  Since I wanted to properly follow the MVVM design pattern, the project used an external framework. Part of the time spend was learning to use the framework. I wonder if I should have focused on the built in tools and then slowly explored the framework. \r\n\r\n*Screenshots of the application can be found in the file Screenshot.pdf\r\n*while writing my project, I used a mercurial repository,so the .hg directory is included and the remote url is\r\nhttps://icarus01.kilnhg.com/Repo/MobileComputing/Group/Code777. My final changes were pusheed to a github repo though","google":"UA-45866674-3","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
